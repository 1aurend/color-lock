## LL Color Lock Tutorial
### Welcome to React!

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a js library for building UI. React code is written in JSX, which is an extension of js that allows it to describe elements of the DOM. See [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) for the official word on JSX. I also highly recommend the tic-tac-toe tutorial in the official React docs if you really want to dig in and learn React.

The two coolest things about React for the LL are (1) it allows us to write modular bits of code called components that we can use again and again and (2) because it's for building UI, it puts interactivity at the center. So let's get started!

This tutorial will teach you core React concept through building a colorful keypad lock. If you clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/1aurend/color-lock.git` in terminal, install dependencies (`npm install --save`), and run `npm start`, you can see a working version of the lock.

To start, you'll want to checkout the starter-code branch (`git checkout starter-pack`). The readme in each branch will contain the full tutorial with one caveat. After the branch `basic-lock`, the tutorial forks to show you two ways to build the lock's functionality, one using class components and one using React's newest addtion Hooks. The readmes in the two forks diverge accordingly.

#### Have fun! (And let me know of any suggestions for usability or errors you find. TIA!)
